# Classroom-Booking-portal
This classroom booking portal was inspired by my college experiences. I noticed that during events, departments, clubs, and the Placement unit, or any other organizing body, need to book classrooms in advance.

With this inspiration, I built a full-stack website for classroom booking. It features user authentication and allows adding, deleting, and updating room details and bookings. The portal also checks for real-time scheduling conflicts and prevents bookings for past dates.

The H2 DBMS is used for storing bookings, user, and room details.It is non-persistent database.
